        SkillsMaxxing is a website for anyone to find helpful links to access skills they need to be successful in their career field(s). 
        We provide a quick quiz for users to help them figure out what courses they may be interested in learning. The information chosen is stored locally.  
        Additionally, in the user's dashboard, there is a customized search bar that is purposefully filtered to only include well-known, reliable, 
        and easy-to-understand resources that users can easily utilize to help them understand a concept.
        We also included a Youtube searchbar, implemented with an API key, for users to search up videos through our website. 
        Although our website could be fleshed out more, the idea of our website is to contain all the tools users need to be successful in their career field(s). 
        We do not want them to have to continue to navigate from tab-to-tab trying to find reliable sources. 
        We want provide them with an all-in-one website to max out their skills!
